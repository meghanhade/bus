myMuni is a way to display multiple MUNI route arrival prediction times in one window, 
large enough and clear enough to see from across the room.

The screen auto-refreshes every 15 seconds.

With a couple minor tweaks, you too can have a personalized arrival prediction list.

First, this is the format the API uses:
http://webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=predictions&a=sf-muni&stopId=<stop id>&routeTag=<route tag>


You only need to change two things in my code to make it your own: the routeTag and the stopId. 
To find this information for your preferred bus lines, use these two links:

MUNI routeTag list: webservices.nextbus.com/service/publicXMLFeed?command=routeList&a=sf-muni
stop id: transit.511.org/schedules/realtimedepartures.aspx#onlystopid

I based my use of D3 on this example: https://gist.github.com/lgrammel/2772585
